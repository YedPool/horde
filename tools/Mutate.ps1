# Mutate.ps1 - prove a suite can fail: break the code on purpose, one way at a time, and require the
# suite to notice.
#
#   powershell -File tools\Mutate.ps1 -Spec test\mutations\<module>.psd1
#
# The spec names a target file, a suite, and a list of mutations. Each mutation is a literal
# find-and-replace that must match EXACTLY ONCE in the target - a find that matches nothing would
# "survive" by never having been applied, which is how a mutation run lies. Each runs against a fresh
# copy of the repository in a throwaway folder, so the working tree is never touched and a run in
# progress elsewhere never sees a broken file.
#
# WHY THIS IS A COMMITTED TOOL. A review of the isolation harness found its commit message claiming
# "mutations M1-M9 each caught" with nothing in the repository to check that against: the mutations
# had been run from a scratch script. A claim a reviewer cannot rerun is not evidence.
#
# A mutation the suite is KNOWN not to catch is declared with Expect = "survives" and a Reason, so the
# gap is written down where a reader can disagree with it, instead of being left out of the spec.
#
# Exit 0 only if every mutation applied exactly once and did what it was expected to.
