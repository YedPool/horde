# DOES THE MUTATION TOOL TELL THE TRUTH? A tool that reports "every mutation caught" is only worth
# what it would report when that is false. So it is run on a tiny fixture twice: once with an honest
# spec it must accept, and once with a spec made of every way a mutation run can lie - a survivor not
# declared as one, a find that never applied, a find that matches more than once, and a gap declared
# without a reason - each of which it must reject.
